## Resubmission
This is a patch release, submitted upon request as the previous release failed under R-oldrelease.

## Test environments
* local macOS install (10.13.2), R 3.4.3
* local linux install (Ubuntu 16.04), R 3.4.3
* Ubuntu (Trusty) on travis-ci

## R CMD check results
There were no ERRORs or WARNINGs. 

There was a note about a potential mis-spelling in the DESCRIPTION (an author name, which is spelled correctly, and "et al."). A second note about a non-ASCII string in a data set refers, again, to an author name in a reference that comes with the data set.

## Downstream dependencies
0 packages with problems.
